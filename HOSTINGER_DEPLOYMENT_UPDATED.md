# 🚀 Hostinger Deployment Guide - Updated

## 📋 Deployment Package Ready
✅ **File**: `hostinger-deployment-updated.zip`
✅ **Size**: Optimized for production
✅ **Assets**: All PDFs, images, and built files included

## 🔧 Backend Considerations

### Current Setup:
- Your frontend is configured to use: `http://localhost:5001/api`
- This will **only work locally** when your server is running

### 🌐 For Production Backend:

#### Option 1: Deploy Backend to Cloud Service
You need to deploy your `server/` folder to a cloud service like:

1. **Railway** (Recommended for MongoDB Atlas)
   - Sign up at railway.app
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Deploy the `server/` folder
   - Get production URL like: `https://your-app.railway.app`

2. **Vercel** (Good for Node.js APIs)
   - Sign up at vercel.com
   - Deploy the `server/` folder
   - Get URL like: `https://your-backend.vercel.app`

3. **Render** (Free tier available)
   - Sign up at render.com
   - Deploy as web service
   - Get URL like: `https://your-app.onrender.com`

#### Option 2: Update Environment for Production
1. Create `.env.production` with your production backend URL:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-production-backend.com/api
   ```
2. Rebuild: `npm run build`
3. Create new deployment ZIP

## 📁 Hostinger Deployment Steps

### 1. Access Hostinger
- Login to your Hostinger hPanel
- Go to **File Manager**
- Navigate to `public_html` folder

### 2. Clean & Upload
- **Delete all existing files** in `public_html`
- Upload `hostinger-deployment-updated.zip`
- **Extract** the ZIP file in `public_html`
- **Delete** the ZIP file after extraction

### 3. Verify File Structure
Your `public_html` should contain:
```
public_html/
├── index.html
├── .htaccess
├── assets/
│   ├── index-CUToMqHJ.js
│   └── index-C73BDDBc.css
├── *.pdf (all your PDF documents)
├── bpi.jpeg
└── qrcode.png
```

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. Basic Website Test
- Visit: `https://yourdomain.com`
- Check: Homepage loads correctly
- Test: Navigation between pages

### 2. Form Functionality
⚠️ **Important**: Forms will **NOT work** until backend is deployed!

### 3. PDF Access Test
- Test: Direct PDF links work
- Example: `https://yourdomain.com/Unified Doc BPI.pdf`

### 4. Mobile & Browser Testing
- Test on different devices
- Verify responsive design
- Check all browsers

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Backend Status:
- ❌ **Forms won't work** without production backend
- ✅ **Static content** will work perfectly
- ✅ **Routing** will work with `.htaccess`

### Next Steps for Full Functionality:
1. **Deploy backend** to cloud service
2. **Update** environment variables
3. **Rebuild** and redeploy frontend

## 🛠️ Quick Commands

```bash
# Rebuild after backend URL change
npm run build

# Create new deployment ZIP
cd dist && zip -r ../hostinger-deployment-new.zip . -x "*.DS_Store"
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If routing doesn't work:
- Check `.htaccess` file is in `public_html`
- Verify file permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)

### If forms don't work:
- Check browser console for API errors
- Ensure backend is deployed and accessible
- Verify environment variables

### If assets don't load:
- Check file paths in browser dev tools
- Verify all files extracted properly
- Clear browser cache

## ✅ Success Checklist
- [ ] Website loads at your domain
- [ ] All pages accessible via navigation
- [ ] PDFs downloadable
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] SSL certificate active
- [ ] Backend deployed (for forms)
- [ ] Forms working (after backend deployment)
